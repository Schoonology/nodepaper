# Nodepaper

Nodepaper is intended to be a super-simple, Node-based CMS that uses the filesystem for storage and Git for version control.

## Purpose

**a.k.a. Another Node CMS? Really?**

Yes. For one, at the time I originally built Nodepaper, I had yet to find an existing, supported CMS that met all of my needs. While I love Wordpress, I wanted to consolidate the technologies that my various projects used (Node) with the tech running my website (so no PHP). _This is not a universally-applicable statement._ In my case, however, Node is necessary. To most people, using Wordpress is preferable.

For two, my personal projects each represent an opportunity to explore and learn new things. For my games, it's everything from cellular automata on a hexagonal coordinate system derived from an isometric projection of unit cubes to modifying Growing Tree algorithms in three-dimensional Euclidean space to put more interesting content on hard-to-reach, non-goal dead ends.

Ergo, Nodepaper.
